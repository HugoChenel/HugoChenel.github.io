            <h2>Graph theory, AI and cancer research</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a PhD candidate involved in <strong>network theory</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> to advance <strong>cancer research</strong>. I explore approaches to better characterize tumor biology and potentially improve therapeutic strategies through AI-driven insights.
            </p>
        </div>

    <!-- Section 2: Biohacking and health optimization -->
    <a href="/biohacking/" class="clickable-box">
        <div class="section" id="biohacking">
            <h2>Biohacking and health optimization</h2>
            <p>
                Through advanced <strong>biohacking protocols</strong>, I’ve achieved <strong>top 1% biomarker levels</strong>. I continuously experiment, test, and adapt methods to optimize both physical and mental performance. I’ll be sharing detailed biohacking strategies and biomarker values.
            </p>
