In developing my training philosophy, I was influenced by some of the most respected names in athletic performance and human optimization: *Ben Greenfield*, *Dr. Andy Galpin*, *Mark Bell*, *Dr. Peter Attia*, *Dr. Andrew Huberman*, *Ben Patrick*, and *Dr. Kelly Starrett*. Their different visions have shaped my training programs, progressively orienting myself toward **weightlifting**, **gymnastics**, **CrossFit** and **running**, participating in endurance events like *Hyrox*. I try to fully develop myself as a hybrid athlete across strength, endurance and explosiveness. All my **personal records** and **competition results** are tracked, serving as benchmarks to evaluate my progress. Regular assessments help fine-tune my approach. 

What follows is an overview of my training components and results. Each one plays a specific role in improving strength, power or endurance, supporting a long-term vision of peak athletic performance.

# Foundations

1 - **Strength and power training**<br>
Strength and power development are one of the most important parts of my training, especially through weightlifting and resistance training. I use a mix of compound movements from powerlifting (bench, military press, squat) or gymnastics (pull-up, dip, muscle-up, chin-up), and high-velocity exercises (plyometrics, olympic lifts) to build a powerful foundation.

2 - **HIIT and anaerobic capacity**<br>
Mixing steady-state endurance work with high-intensity interval training is ideal to improve VO2 max and lactate threshold, thus transforming your anaerobic capacity. It can be in various forms, from sprint intervals to crossfit WOD.

3 - **Aerobic base and cardio conditioning**<br>
I highly value building a strong aerobic base for sustained endurance. I incorporate low-intensity and long-duration aerobic sessions to build an efficient cardiovascular base, which supports various body processes (recovery, fat metabolism) but also provides a foundation for higher-intensity efforts.

4 - **Periodized training**<br>
Cycle through different training focuses such as endurance, strength and power phases to allow for recovery/adaptation. I align training phases with specific athletic goals of the period.

5 - **Mobility and movement quality**<br>
I highlight the importance of natural functional movement to prevent injuries and improve overall performance. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm dedicating time to mobility work to improve range of motion, with or without weight.

6 - **Functional training**<br>
The incorporation of functional movement patterns ensures that skills are practical, transferable to real-life situations. By incorporating compound lifts, the body is trained as a cohesive unit rather than isolating muscles, which by experience greatly improves coordination, balance and strength in most settings. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs also important to vary exercise inclination, hand positioning and equipment type (switching between barbells, dumbbells and kettlebells): it adds layers of complexity that challenge the body in meaningful ways. Each adjustment recruits muscles differently and enhances neuromuscular coordination (building resilience in various movement patterns).

7 - **Recovery**<br>
Recovery is an essential component to maintain high performance over the long term and don‚Äôt break the body. Sleep and adequate nutrition are the most important but I also include frequent cryotherapy and sauna sessions as well as daily breathwork. Evaluating your current state before training is a good idea with CNS tap tests based on reaction time (nervous system fatigue) and RHR/HRV monitoring (stress/fatigue level) using Whoop, Oura ring or Garmin. Use these tools to adjust training based on recovery status.

8 - **Nutrition**<br>
Don‚Äôt jump on any diet but find an individualized diet that helps your performance.
Nutrient timing can be important (carb backloading in my case) and balance macronutrients to match training intensity. Generally, you need to incorporate unprocessed whole foods, adapt carbohydrates based on your need, and consider intermittent fasting or fasted training to enhance metabolic flexibility.

9 - **Mental resilience**<br>
To face physical challenges easily, I encourage the development of mental toughness with exercises like long duration endurance challenges, cold/hot exposure or any deliberate discomfort training. Breathwork like the Wim Hof method can also be excellent for pain tolerance.

10 - **Biohacking and monitoring**<br>
I promote personalized and data-driven approaches using tools like wearables (HR monitors, sleep trackers) and perform frequent bloodwork to make smart training variations based on biomarkers. They can guide personalized adjustments to amplify results and performance.
