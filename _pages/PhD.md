üîç My PhD research is based around the development of computational models to decode the complexities of tumors, with a strong emphasis on **multi-omics data integration** and **gene regulatory networks**. I‚Äôm involved in the field of **Digital Twins (DTs)** for cancer research, enabling a more personalized and predictive approach to oncology. By harnessing data from multiple biological sources (transcriptomics, proteomics and beyond), DTs platform could be used for virtual clinical trials and in silico drug screenings.

Currently, I‚Äôm working as a research engineer at **Evotec** while pursuing my PhD at the **Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT)**. My research is supported by Evotec, allowing me to explore innovative approaches in cancer research and drug discovery.
Specifically, my PhD project is centered on:<br>
- **Integrating multi-omics data**: Combining various biological data sources to better explain cancer mechanisms, more particularly in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).
- **Multilayer network inference**: Experienced in various network inference method and tools to find complex relationships within the data.
- **Virtual compound screening**: Leveraging these insights to conduct virtual screenings of potential drug candidates on in-silico molecularly and clinically realistic cohorts.

Below is an overview of my publications showcasing my contributions to the field, the conferences where I had the opportunity to present my research work, my PhD thesis, as well as my academic/industry experiences and education.
